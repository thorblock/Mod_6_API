Module 6 API Challenge

The WeatherPy folder contains the two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy notebooks. Additionally, in output_data, there are the cities.csv and the figures generated within WeatherPy analysis. Figures 5 and 6 are extra outputs of the maps generated in VacationPy using holoviews. Please note that these figures will not have the hoverables that the notebook generates with hvplot. 

My api_keys file is blank in this instance of the repo. GitGuardian emailed me a warning, and I panicked. Removing the keys I previously generated, although admittedly if someone still wanted to use them, they can see it in my commit history. Clearly, I don't understand .gitignore. I'm wondering if it's a folder issue, but ultimately looking at items I don't know how to define tracked versus untracked as a property.
